# GuessingGame

Welcome to this  extremely unorthodox guessing game. Here are the key points:

  1. This is my first time really creating something solely with jQuery,HTML,CSS,JS
       - I did little things but never anything with functionality.
 
  2. Being that this is so, I figured I could learn a lot by creating something funny
     and fun whilst experimenting on doing things that I have never before done.
  
  3. It is extremely simple and was a project primarily designed by the coding bootcamp 
     I am attending, Fullstack Academy. Though I only used some of the ideas that were
     expressed but, of course, some of the logic is fundemental to the program, ie.
     the JS. It was done through test-first that they created.
     
This game exemplifies this logic. It is funny, mindless, and likely not worth more than 
a few minutes of your time. Nonetheless, it is purely unique and you may, pardon me for
sounding like an old folk for a moment, get a kick out of it.

Thanks for checking this out and if you give it a try, hope you get a few laughs!
